# avryOS: Intelligence-Driven Web Operating System

**avryOS** is a high-fidelity, web-based operating system simulation built with React 19. It serves as a unified environment for multi-modal applications, blending the productivity-focused layout of **Ubuntu Unity** with the modern, glassmorphic aesthetics of **Windows 11**.

## ⚡ Core Philosophy
avryOS treats the web browser as a hardware-agnostic kernel. It implements a custom window manager, a virtual file system (VFS), and a deep-link AI integration (Avry AI) to provide a seamless desktop experience inside a single-page application.

## 🏗️ Technical Highlights
- **Multi-Sphere Layouts**: A context-aware UI that morphs between Desktop, Tablet, Mobile, TV, and Gaming (PS5-inspired) modes based on viewport or user selection.
- **Advanced Window Management**: Precision window snapping with a custom grid engine, support for modal child windows, and workspace isolation.
- **Identity Synthesis**: Multi-user support with organization-based session persistence using local storage caching.
- **Neural Integration**: Native Google Gemini 3.0 Flash integration for system-wide intelligence and streaming chat.
- **Virtual Storage**: A modular VFS that supports local "disk" simulation and cloud provider provisioning (S3/Dropbox patterns).

## 🚀 Quick Start
1. **Authentication**: Use passcode `1234` for any identity.
2. **Neural Spotlight**: Press `Alt + Space` to search for apps or execute `avry://` protocols.
3. **Workspace Switcher**: Use the monitor icon in the dock or `Alt + Tab` (Desktop mode).
